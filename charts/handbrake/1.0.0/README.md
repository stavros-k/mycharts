# Handbrake

## Introduction

This Chart installs Handbrake in a Docker with VNC viewer

## Configuration

The source page of the docker explains in great detail how to configure handbrake with Enviromental Variables.

## NOTE

For now it's not possible to add extra watch folder from the UI. When TrueCharts supports that, this chart should be updated to reflect that.
